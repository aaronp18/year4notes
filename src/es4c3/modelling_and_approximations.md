# Modelling & Approximations

## Modelling

Why are models needed?
- Idea concrete
- Common basis for discussion
- Simplfied, finite representation (as model is not reality)
- Support & imrpove understanding
- Comparison of different solutions
- Prediction of behaviour, charactersists, problems, weakeness

Models Benefits
- Test in virtual mode
- Detect errors early in design prototypes
- Easy changes in design
- Validate tecnological choices
- Reduce tyme to market

**Verification**:
    - Process of determining a computational model accuratly represents underlying mathematical model and it's solution

**Validation**:
    - Process of determining the degree to which a model is accurante representation of real world (from perspective of the intended uses of the model)
