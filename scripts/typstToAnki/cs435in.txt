*What is the CIA triad?*

#pagebreak()
Confidentiality, Availability, Integrity.

The 3 fundamental aspects of Computer Security.

#pagebreak()

*Give 2 non-CIA security requirements*

#pagebreak()
1. Authentication
2. Non-repudiatioin

#pagebreak()

*What is the weakest link property?*

#pagebreak()

The overall strength of a security system is the strength of its weakest link.

#pagebreak()

*What is a 2-time pad attack?*

#pagebreak()

If using an XOR operation on a "one-time pad" over 2 different messages. You get the following results

$M_1 xor K = C_1$

$M_2 xor K = C_2$

It is the case that $C_1 xor C_2 = M_1 xor M_2$ which you can then break into based on language redundancies.
#pagebreak()

*What is phishing?*

#pagebreak()

Is when an attacker attempts to "lure" a user to give them private information willingly. 

Usually done via emails or messages asking for personal information.

#pagebreak()

*What is a spoof site, and how can you recognise one?*

#pagebreak()

A spoof site is a fake site that aims to imitate a real site. The goal is to convince users they are on the real site so they provide private personal information.

Usually there are issues on the page such as:
- Don't use SSL
- Inconsistencies
- Grammatical Errors
- Odd URLs

#pagebreak()

*Give 3 ways you can disguise a url?*

#pagebreak()

Typejacking - using similar (but not the same) unicode characters

Using IP Address

Have the real site be a substring in the url.

#pagebreak()

*How can you defend against phishing attacks?*

#pagebreak()

Anti-spam software

Security plugins

Trusted Path (Windows)

Two-factor authentication

#pagebreak()

*What is Smishing?*

#pagebreak()

SMS + phishing


#pagebreak()

*What is CAPTCHA?*

#pagebreak()

Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart.

The goal is to determine wheteher a user is human or not.


#pagebreak()

*Give an example of an attack on CAPTCHA? and what is the CAPTCHA "sweet spot"*

#pagebreak()

An attack on CAPTCHA is when each character always had the same number of pixels. This meant you could encode a character look up table.

Protocol Attack:
 - Man in the middle
 - Outsourcing

A sweet spot is a term to reference the idea difficulty of a Captcha to distinguish humans from computers.


#pagebreak()

*How is reCAPTCHA different to CAPTCHA?*

#pagebreak()

reCAPTCHA gives site admins the flexiblity to decide whether a user is given a CAPTCHA test, where as CAPTCHA is the test itself.

#pagebreak()

*Define:*

* - Cipher*

* - Key*

* - Keyspace*
#pagebreak()

- Cipher: a cryptographic algorithm to perform encryption and decryption
- Key: Used for encryption and decryption
- Keyspace: the range of the key

#pagebreak()

*What are the 4 general types of attack on cryptography schemes?*

#pagebreak()

1. Ciphertext-only
2. Known-plaintext
3. Chosen-plaintext
4. Chosen-ciphertext

#pagebreak()

*Explain confusion and diffusion*

#pagebreak()

- confusion: Obsecures relationship between plaintext and ciphertext
- diffusion: Dissipates redundancy of plaintext by spreading it over ciphertext.

#pagebreak()

*What is a substitution cipher? And what is it's formal definition*

#pagebreak()

A cipher that replaces a refernce of 1 character with another via a mapping.

e.g. Monoalphabetic cipher, polyalphabetic cipher.

Let $P=C=Z_26$. $K$ consists of all possible permutations of the 26 symbols. For each permutation $pi in K$, define

$e_pi (x) = pi(x) mod 26$

$d_pi (y) = pi^(-1) (x) mod 26$

keyspace = 26!
#pagebreak()

*What is the formal definition of a shift cipher?*

#pagebreak()

Let $P = C = K = Z_26$ For $0<=K<=25$ define

$e_k(x) = (x+K) mod 26$

$d_k(y) = (y - K) mod 26$

#pagebreak()

*Why is a shift cipher no good?*

#pagebreak()

Keyspace is only 26. Easy to brute force.

#pagebreak()

*Why is a substitution cipher no good?*

#pagebreak()

Can analyse frequency of characters to gain information between the ciphertext and plain text.

#pagebreak()

*What is a vigenere cipher?*

#pagebreak()

A polyalphabetic cipher based on the idea of combining multiple caeser ciphers.

e.g.

K = 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3

M = B E R E A D Y O K

c = C G U F C G Z Q N

#pagebreak()

*How do you break a vigenere cipher?*

#pagebreak()

1. Find key length
Use Kasiski test.

Search for identical segments and count the number of positions apart. Find common divisors.

Or use index of coincidence.

$I_c (x) = (sum_(i = 0)^25mat(f_i;2))/mat(n;2) = (sum_(i = 0)^25f_i(f_i - 1))/n(n-1) approx sum_(i=0)^25 p_i^2$

In English text this value is usually 0.065. So can iterate through keylengths and separate text into groups until all groups have roughly 0.065 index of coincidence.

2. Find rotation values

Once you have the keylength you can brute force through all possible keys in $26^("key length")$ iterations.

#pagebreak()

*What is a one-time pad?*

#pagebreak()

A "perfect" cryptography scheme where $c_i = k_i xor m_i forall i in 1,2,3...$ 

It is impractical as you would need an infinitely long key.

#pagebreak()

*Bayes' theorem*

#pagebreak()

$p(E_1 | E_2) = (P(E_1)P(E_2 | E_1))/P(E_2)$

#pagebreak()

*Define perfect secrecy*

#pagebreak()

A cryptosystem has perfect secrecy if

$p(m|c) = p(m) forall m in M, c in C$

#pagebreak()

*How can we make OTP practical?*

#pagebreak()

Stream Ciphers.

Basic idea is to use a shorter key to generate a really long key.

#pagebreak()

*Explain Synchronous stream ciphers*

#pagebreak()

Construct the key stream from the key only.

Can use a recurrence algorithm to construct the cipher e.g.:

$k_(i+m) = sum_(j=0)^(m-1)c_j k_(i+j) mod 2$

#pagebreak()

*What's the issue with a synchronous stream cipher?*

#pagebreak()

After a period, the key will repeat.

#pagebreak()

*How is a synchronous stream cipher implemented in hardware?*

#pagebreak()

Using a Lienar Feedback Shift Register (LFSR)

#image("lfsr.png")

#pagebreak()

*Give 3 attacks on stream ciphers*

#pagebreak()

two-time pad attack

No Integrity;
- m = "Transfer £100 to Alice"
- c' = $c xor "Alice" xor "Eve"$
- c = $K xor "Alice"$
- so c' = $K xor "Eve"$

Algorithmic weakness e.g. Content Scramble System for MPEG-2

#pagebreak()

*How was Content Scramble System (CSS) broken?*

#pagebreak()

1. Try all possible 17-bit LFSR to get 20 bytes output
2. Subtract from the first 20 bytes of stream output
3. If consistent with 25-bit LFSR, found the key!

#pagebreak()

*What is Iterated Key Construction in a Block Cipher*

#pagebreak()

Take a key K, and break into n keys via a scheduling algorithm. Use each $k_i$ to encrypt successive blocks of plaintext.

#pagebreak()

*What is a Pseudo Random Function? and what is a Pseudo Random Permutation?*

#pagebreak()

PRF: 

$F: K times X -> Y$

s.t. Exists "efficient" algorithm to evaluate $F(k, x)$

PRP:

$E: K times X -> X$

s.t.
1. Exists "efficient" deterministic algorithm to evaluate $E(k, x)$
2. The function $E(k,.)$ is one-to-one
3. Exists "efficient" inversion algorithm $D(k,.)$

#pagebreak()

*When is a PRP equal to a PRF?*

#pagebreak()

1. X = Y
2. It is invertible

#pagebreak()

*What is a feistel network?*

#pagebreak()

```
For i = 0,1,...,n-1
  L_i_1 = R_i
  R_i_1 = L_i xor F(k_i, R_i)
End
```

Should not swap R and L in last layer so it's easier to invert.

#pagebreak()

*Explain the steps of the F function in a Feistel network?*

#pagebreak()

1. The input (32 bits) is expanded to 48 bits and then XOR'd with the key k.
2. S-boxes
  - 48 bits are split into 8 6-bits, which then go through an S-box to become 8 4-bits
  - #image("s-box.png")
3. P-box
  - (statically) randomly changes the output of the S-boxes.

#pagebreak()

*What to keep in mind when choosing S and P boxes?*

#pagebreak()

Should not be random.

Choose boxes s.t.
- No output bit should be close to a linear function of the input bits.
- S-boxes area 4-to-1 mapping.

#pagebreak()

*Why is double encryption DES not much more secure than DES?*

#pagebreak()

It is susceptible to a Meet in the Middle Attack.

If an attacker knows a pair of ciphertext and plaintext. They can attempt to encrypt the plaintext with all $2^56$ keys and decrypt the ciphertext with all $2^56$ keys. Can then look for a match.

Although the key is 112 bits, it only had 57-bits of entropy.

#pagebreak()

*What is a better alternative to Double DES?*

#pagebreak()

Triple DES - 168 bit key size = 112 bit security.

#pagebreak()

*What is the fundamental difference between AES and DES*

#pagebreak()

DES = Feistel

AES = Substitution-Permutation

#pagebreak()

*Overview of AES*

#pagebreak()
#image("aes-overview.png")
#pagebreak()

*What are the 3 main steps in each round of Substitution-Permutation*

#pagebreak()

1. SubBytes
 - A mapping from input bytes to output bytes
 - input is an element of a finite field $G F(2^8)$
 - Compute the inverse
 - For i = 0, 1, .., 7
  
 $quad quad$do $b_i = (a_i + a_i_4 + a_i_5 + a_i_6 + a_i_y + c_i) mod 2$

2. ShiftRows
  - #image("shift-rows.png")

3. MixColumns
  - Each byte in a column is replaced by 2 times that byte, plus 3 times the next bytem plus the byte that comes next, plus the byte that follows. (obviously, duh).


#pagebreak()

*How does AES key scheduling work?*

#pagebreak()

Expanding the 16 byte key eleven times to 176 bytes (or 44 words).

#image("AES-Key-Scheduling.png")

#pagebreak()

*What are the 5 Modes of operation for AES covered in this module?*

#pagebreak()

- Electronic Code Book
- Cipher Block Chaining
- Cipher Feedback
- Output Feedback
- Counter

#pagebreak()

*Explain Electronic Codebook*

#pagebreak()

Each plaintext block is encrypted independently to generate ciphertext.

Can cause data leakage by identifying patterns between blocks.

#pagebreak()

*Explain Cipher block chaining*

#pagebreak()

The input to each encryption block is:
 - previous blocks ciphertext (or initialisation vector) xor plaintext
 - key

Input is padded so the entire input is a multiple of 16 bytes.

Encryption can then not be parallelised.

Can recover from losing a whole block, but not a single byte.

#pagebreak()

*How does PKCS7 Padding work?*

#pagebreak()

The value of each byte added, is the total number of pad bytes used.

e.g. if 4 bytes are padded, the padding looks like: 04040404

#pagebreak()

*What is the padding oracle attack?*

#pagebreak()

If a server errors if the padding is incorrect, an attacker can use this information to figure out the plaintext.

Can cycle through XORing a random R to the penultimate block and feeding the input to the server. cycle the final byte $r_15$ until the server accepts. We know that $d_15 xor r_15 = 01$, and so $d_15 = 01 xor r_15$. We can then use the IV/original ciphertext to calculate $p_15 = d_15 xor "iv"_15$. 

#pagebreak()

*What is cipher feedback mode?*

#pagebreak()

Similar to CBC, but we encrypt before xoring with plaintext.

#image("cipher-feedback.png")

#pagebreak()

*What is output feedback mode?*

#pagebreak()

Similar to CFB, but we chain the output of encryption, not the XOR of encryption and plaintext.

This is essentially a stream cipher.

#pagebreak()

*What is counter mode?*

#pagebreak()

The input to each encryption is a counter, that was randomly initialised. The output is then XOR'd with the plaintext.

Easily parallelisable, acts as a stream cipher.

#pagebreak()

*How does the NIC receive a packet? What does promiscuous mode do? What is the WiFi equivalent of promiscuous mode, and what are its limitations?*

#pagebreak()

NIC hears all frames on a wire, when it finds a packet addressed to it (by comparing MAC addresses), the frame is copied into a buffer and dispatched to user programs. Frames that aren't destined to the NIC are discarded.

In promiscuous mode, the NIC passes every frame from the network to the kernel.

The WiFi equivalent is monitor mode. Limitations: interference means that the WiFi card can't copy everything, only captures 802.11 frames on the channel the device is listening to so may miss info on other channels.

#pagebreak()

*What does a BSD packet filter (BPF) do? What are the limitations of receiving packets using raw sockets, and what is the solution?*

#pagebreak()

BPF allows a user program to attach a (combination of) filter(s) to a socket, which tells the kernel to discard unwanted packets.

Limitations of raw sockets are: portability issues, lack of optimisation, & difficulty in setting filters. Solution is to use the pcap library, which has a standard API across all platforms & allows programmers to specify rules using human-readable Boolean expressions.

#pagebreak()

*Define packet spoofing. Why are raw sockets preferred for this? What's the procedure to spoof a UDP packet?*

#pagebreak()

Packet spoofing is when some critical information in the packet is forged.

Raw sockets allow us to construct the entire packet (including header fields) before sending it out.

Procedure for UDP:
- Capture UDP packet of interest
- Make a copy
- Replace the UDP data field with a new message & swap the source & destination fields
- Send the spoofed reply

#pagebreak()

*List the pros of using C vs Scapy for constructing a spoofed packet.*

#pagebreak()

Simpler in Scapy but faster in C.

#pagebreak()

*Define endianness.*

#pagebreak()

The order in which a given multi-byte data item is stored in memory.

#pagebreak()

*What's the difference between little endian & big endian? Which is network order? Why is a standardised network order needed?*

#pagebreak()

Little endian puts the small end in memory first; big endian puts the big end in memory first.

Network order is big endian.

Standard required as computers using different byte orders to each other will misunderstand the communications.

#pagebreak()

*Describe the steps in the TCP handshake.*

#pagebreak()

SYN - client sends a packet to the server using a randomly generated number as its sequence number. Server will use a TCB to store information about the connection.

SYN-ACK - server replies using its own randomly generated number as its sequence number.

ACK - client sends an ACK packet to conclude the handshake. The ACK prompts the server to take the TCB out of the queue. SYN-ACK will be resent if the ACK doesn't arrive. Eventually the TCB is discarded once it times out.

#pagebreak()

*Describe a SYN flooding attack. What is a countermeasure?*

#pagebreak()

Continuously send a lot of SYN packets to the server so that queue space is consumed by more and more TCB records. Use random source IP addresses to avoid being blocked by firewalls.

Countermeasure is a SYN cookie - calculate a keyed hash from the information in the packet using a secret key and send to the client, don't store the TCB. When the client sends the ACK, they will respond with cookie+1. An attacker will never receive the cookie.

#pagebreak()

*There's two ways to close a TCP connection. What are they?*

#pagebreak()

TCP FIN
- The #emoji.star.arc civilised #emoji.star.arc way
- A sends a FIN packet to B
- B ACKs, which closes the A-to-B communication
- B repeats to close the entire connections

TCP RST
- One of the parties sends an RST packet to immediately break the connection
- Only meant to be for emergency/error

#pagebreak()

*What's the idea behind a TCP reset attack? Where can you get any info needed?*

#pagebreak()

Break up a TCP connection between A and B by sending an RST packet with the following fields set correctly:
- Source IP address & port
- Destination IP address & port
- A sequence number within the receive window

Use Wireshark to get the necessary window.

#pagebreak()

*How does a TCP Reset attack work on Telnet, SSH and Video-streaming connections? Are there any situations where the attack isn't possible/there could be actions taken?*

#pagebreak()

- Telnet: use an existing netwox tool or write your own program
- SSH: impossible if encryption is done below the transport layer. O/w same as Telnet.
- Video-streaming: use netwox 78 to reset each packet that comes from the user machine. If RST packets are sent continuously to a server, the behaviour is suspicious & punitive actions may be taken against the user.

#pagebreak()

*Describe a TCP session hijacking attack.*

#pagebreak()

Inject data into an established connection. Spoof a TCP packet with these fields set correctly:
- Source IP address & port
- Destination IP address & port
- Sequence number within the receive window

#pagebreak()

*How do you hijack a Telnet connection? What are the consequences of a highjacked TCP connection?*

#pagebreak()

Steps:
- User establishes a telnet connection with the server
- Use Wireshark to sniff the traffic
- Retrieve the destination port, source port & sequence number

Consequences:
- User program freezes
- Retransmission packets between user & server
- Deadlock: client will think the packets are out-of-order and retransmit, server will discard the retransmitted packets as duplicates
- Arbitrary command execution, including getting a reverse shell

#pagebreak()

*How can you defend against TCP attacks? What are these defences effective/ineffective against?*

#pagebreak()

- Make it difficult to spoof packets: not effective against local attacks.
- Encrypt the payload: effective against TCP session hijacking, not effective against SYN flooding and TCP reset attacks.

#pagebreak()

*Define a firewall. What are the requirements?*

#pagebreak()

Part of a computer system/network designed to stop unauthorised traffic flowing from one network to another, allowing the separation of trusted & untrusted components of a network, and the differentiation of networks within a trusted network.

Requirements
- All traffic between trust zones should pass through the firewall
- Only authorised traffic (defined by the security policy) should pass through
- The firewall itself must be immune to penetration, which is achieved by using a hardened system with secured OSs

#pagebreak()

*What are the 3 access policies of a firewall? What are the 3 actions a firewall can take?*

#pagebreak()

Policies
- User control: control access to data based on user role
- Service control: control access by the type of service offered by the host
- Direction control: determine the direction in which a request may be initiated & are allowed to flow through the firewall

Actions
- Accepted: allow the connected network/host through
- Denied: don't allow entry to the other side of the firewall
- Rejected: denied, but you're told through an ICMP packet

#pagebreak()

*What are the 2 types of filtering and 3 types of firewall?*

#pagebreak()

Types of filtering
- Ingress: inspect incoming traffic to safeguard an internal network & prevent external attacks
- Egress filtering: inspect outgoing traffic & prevent users reaching the outside

Packet Filter/Stateless Firewall: control traffic based on information in the packet headers, don't pay attention to whether the packet is part of a stream, don't maintain the packet states.

Stateful Firewall: track the state of the traffic in a connection state table by monitoring all connection interactions until they close.

Application/Proxy Firewall: control input, output & access from/to an application/service by impersonating the intended recipient. Data on the connection is analysed up to the application layer to determine whether the packet should be allowed/rejected.

#pagebreak()

*How do you build a packet filter?*

#pagebreak()

Can be done inside the kernel, using either:
- Netfilter: provides hooks at critical points on the packet traversal path inside a Linux kernel
- Loadable kernel modules: allow privileged users to dynamically add/remove modules to the kernel
- Built-in packet filters

#pagebreak()

*How do you build a stateful firewall?*

#pagebreak()

`nf_conntrack` is a connection tracking framework in the Linux kernel built on top of netfilter, able to store context in memory.

Each packet will be marked as one of:
- NEW: connection is starting & the packet is part of a valid sequence. Only exists for a connection if the firewall has only seen traffic in one direction
- ESTABLISHED: connection has been established & is two-way
- RELATED: special state that helps to establish relationships among different connections
- INVALID: packet doesn’t follow the expected behaviour of a connection

#pagebreak()

*How do you build a application/proxy firewall? What is a key challenge in doing this and what are potential solutions?*

#pagebreak()

Typical implementation is a proxy.

Critical challenge is ensuring all web traffic goes through the proxy server

Solutions:
- Configure each host to redirect all web traffic to the proxy
- Place web proxies on a network bridge that connects internal & external networks

#pagebreak()

*What are other applications of a web proxy?*

#pagebreak()

Anonymising proxy: hide the origin of a network request from servers

Evade egress filtering

#pagebreak()

*Describe the Static Port Forwarding/SSH Tunnelling technique for firewall evasion.*

#pagebreak()

- 2 devices, home & inner, want to communicate but there's a firewall that blocks access between the two, but not between home and a secret 3rd machine called outer.

- Set up a tunnel between home and outer
- On the home end, the tunnel receives TCP packets from the telnet client
- Forwards TCP data to outer, which places the data in another TCP packet set for inner, which will be invisible to the firewall

#pagebreak()

*Describe the Dynamic Port Forwarding technique for firewall evasion. What is the advantage of this method over static port forwarding?*

#pagebreak()

Set up an ssh tunnel between a localhost port and the home machine

Redirect all web requests to go through this port

Set up a SOCKS proxy on the localhost: ssh will send the TCP data over the tunnel to the home machine, which will communicate with the blocked site.

Advantage: static has to be done on a per-website basis

#pagebreak()

*Describe the Reverse SSH Tunnelling technique for firewall evasion.*

#pagebreak()

A firewall may block incoming ssh sessions. Assuming it doesn't block outgoing ssh sessions, reverse ssh tunnelling can be used to access an internal website.

#pagebreak()

*Describe the VPN technique for firewall evasion.*

#pagebreak()

Create a tunnel between a computer inside the network & another one outside

IP packets sent via this tunnel

Tunnel traffic is encrypted, so firewalls can't see what is inside & can't filter.

#pagebreak()

*Describe the two methods for IP Tunnelling.*
